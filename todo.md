take the data from Reifax JSON and ability to insert data 

1) Massage the data according to current variable names ?

2) Make sure not to insert data thats already there. 

3) Ability to insert only the top 30 elements from an array.  ( I can also do it in teh data massage by adding a key value as counter, )

So that it only inserts first 30 elements, and when counter = 0 done. 

or delete them.

01-25-17 or more meaningful 

make sure the :id params with meanjs  / / /   doesnt fuck it up.
